Website created during Alura's Front-end Challenge 2. The challenge objective is to simulate a real work situation, where the user must create a site for a client following a request.

We were given a template in [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Ve4hpTfmMa7yAFneoGtGKD/Alura-Challenge---Edição-Front-end?node-id=207%3A1446) to use as a base and cards on Trello to guide us.

## Languages

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript
