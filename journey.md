## What I've learned

This was my first time building a website from scratch. Here's what I've been experiencing and learning

- I wanted to store the data somewhere so I learned how to use local storage and session storage
- Learned about CSS variables and how they're useful for scaling and maintenance
- Learned about BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) and how they're useful for organizing the code
- How hard it is to organize files and how things get complicated fast when adding new features
- Aparently there's a whole subject about how to structure your folders and files and I'm very interested in it
- Learned how to use external libraries like Highlight.js
- How to convert HEX to rgb and vice versa
- Started reading Clean Code from Uncle Bob and will be refactoring this code as I learn more
- Learned about screaming architecture and I'll try to use it here
